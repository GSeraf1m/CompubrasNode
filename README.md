# CompubrasNode
A NodeJS API using Express, in [this](https://github.com/GabeSerafim/CompubrasNode/tree/before-sequelize) branch with only express and node and in [this](https://github.com/GabeSerafim/CompubrasNode/tree/sequelize) branch with sequelize as ORM also, but both branches work really similar.

You can clone and test yourself creating a MySQL database with the same data as [here](https://github.com/GabeSerafim/CompubrasNode/blob/master/utils/database.js)
